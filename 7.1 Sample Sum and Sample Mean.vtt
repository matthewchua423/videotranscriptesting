00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:05.040
okay this is the last topic for SACE

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.320
stage 2 methods it's called sampling and

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.440
confidence </br></br>

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.480
intervals and as we do more and more of

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.759
this topic you'll see that it's

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.240
basically a combination of the last two

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.519
topics we did which are discrete random

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.119
variables and continuous random

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.920
variables we can divide this topic up

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.800
into two parts which I want you to keep

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.399
in mind as we go through this series of

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.000
videos the first part is called sample

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.559
means and the second part is called

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.559
sample proportions in this video we're

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:41.760
going to go through an introduction to

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.440
sampling and specifically sample means

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.600
so first let's talk about what sampling

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.480
actually is let's say that we wanted to

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.719
find the average height of every human

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.120
being in the world practically this

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.480
would be impossible because we'd have to

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.079
measure every single person right so

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.080
instead what we can do is we can take a

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.799
smaller sample of the world population

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:11.799
let's say of 100 people and we could

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:14.880
average the height of this sample of 100

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.360
and use that sample mean to average the

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.400
true population mean height so that's

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.240
what sampling is used for we take a

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.479
sample which is meant to be

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.600
representative of the whole population

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.799
when we take a sample of a population

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.240
there are two types of variables that we

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.000
can

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.280
analyze sample means and Sample

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.000
proportions a sample mean is the average

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.119
data value of a population so for

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.000
example the average height or the

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.799
average duration of a song a sample

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.240
proportion is the percentage of data

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.079
values which fall into a particular

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.520
category so for example the percentage

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.320
of people who are above 6t tall or the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.878
percentage of songs which are between 2

00:02:09.878 --> 00:02:13.200
and 3 minutes long so because of this

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.599
notice that sample proportions always

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.400
have to take a value between 0 and 1

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.000
where zero means none of the population

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.120
falls into that category and one means

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.840
100% of the population falls into that

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.599
category on the other hand sample means

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.360
can take any value because they just

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.280
represent the average data value of a

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.360
population keep this table in mind as we

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.280
work through the next few videos the

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.800
first few will'll be talking about

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.319
sample means and then we'll go on to

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.239
sample proportions let's talk about

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.959
sample means first the sample mean is

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.519
just the mean of a sample right so to

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.720
talk about sample means we have to

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.360
Define form formulas on how to calculate

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.480
the sample mean and actually these

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.040
formulas are things we've already

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.920
learned about in statistics in Middle

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.560
School let's say we had a sample of

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.640
three people and their heights were 160

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.760
170 and 180 cm well how would we

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.920
calculate the mean of this sample we

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.440
would just add these three Heights

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.040
together and divide by three because

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.920
three is the sample size right so when

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.360
we're talking about sample means the

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.879
first thing that we do is Define the

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:34.760
sample sum we write this down as SN

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.360
where n is the sample size so in this

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.840
example that I did over here this would

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.720
be S3 adding up the three Heights SN is

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.720
the sample sum or just the sum of all of

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.080
the things in the sample so the formula

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.280
for this is we just add them up we can

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.239
denote this with X1 + X2 plus all the

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.239
way to xn again this just means means we

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.040
add the things in the sample like this

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.200
once we add the things in the sample up

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.360
to find the sample mean we have to

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.040
divide by the sample size so the sample

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.920
mean we write as xar n and this is found

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.160
by dividing SN by n hopefully that makes

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.519
sense look at this formula here we have

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.960
the sample sum on top which is the sum

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.440
of the three Heights and then we divide

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.919
by three because that's how many people

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.360
we have in our sample so we could also

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.840
write this as X1 + X2 all the way to xn/

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.919
n let's talk about the properties of SN

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:44.199
and xrn SN and xrn are actually random

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:47.039
variables themselves the reason for this

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:49.600
is because we could take lots of

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.320
different samples and every time we

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.199
would have a slightly different sample

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:58.120
sum and Sample mean for example this is

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.320
my sample of three people

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.840
but I could then go and Sample a

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.520
different set of five people and measure

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.960
their heights as 171 172 and 173 we

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.560
divide by three to find the sample mean

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.720
so we could see that these two represent

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.840
different samples from the same

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.199
population we just happen to pick

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:24.080
different people they also have slightly

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.720
different sample means this sample mean

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.960
is 170 whereas this sample mean is 172

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.319
so if we kept doing this and took lots

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:36.039
and lots of samples of three people each

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:38.360
of these samples would have a slightly

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.840
different sample mean and therefore both

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.280
the sample mean and the sample sum are

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.000
continuous random variables meaning that

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
they each have a mean and a standard

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.800
deviation which depend on the true

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.360
population mean so if we say that mu is

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.360
the true population mean and and sigma

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.639
is the true population standard

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:05.360
deviation then there are formulas we can

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.240
use to calculate the mean and the

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.919
standard deviation of these two random

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:14.039
variables the mean of the sample sum is

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:18.960
written as Mu SN and this is found by

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.520
multiplying n by the true population

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.319
mean this should make sense because

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:26.440
let's say that the true population mean

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.160
height was 170 cm so that would be this

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.919
value here right well if we kept taking

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:36.360
samples of three people we would expect

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.400
that those samples would have a sample

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.479
sum which is approximately 3 * 170 n *

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:46.400
mu the standard deviation of the sample

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.599
sum is written as Sigma SN and this is

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:53.720
equal to the standard deviation of the

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.160
population multiplied by the square root

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.440
of n the reason why there's a square

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.520
root here and it's it's not just n Sigma

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.479
is because the variance if you recall is

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:07.560
the square of the standard deviation so

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.479
the variance would be n * the variance

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:12.720
of the population and then when we

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.720
square root it to get the standard

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.639
deviation that's where this square root

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:19.720
comes from okay the mean of the sample

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:24.680
mean is written as Mu xn and this is

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.560
just equal to the population mean so to

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.879
give a real life interpretation

00:07:29.879 --> 00:07:34.720
if the true average height was 170 cm if

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.520
we took lots and lots of samples of

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.280
three people and averaged the height of

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.120
each of those samples we would expect

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.960
most of those averages to be about 170

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.879
the standard deviation of xar n is equal

00:07:50.879 --> 00:07:53.000
to the standard deviation of the

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.120
population /un n the reason why it's

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.680
like this is because record that the

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:04.000
sample mean is found by dividing SN by n

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.759
so if we took this standard deviation

00:08:06.759 --> 00:08:09.960
here which is Sigma root n that's the

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.759
standard deviation of the sample sum and

00:08:12.759 --> 00:08:15.639
we divided it by n to get the sample

00:08:15.639 --> 00:08:18.960
mean like we do here then simplifying

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.199
this gives us Sigma over root n if

00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:23.840
you're confused at this one just

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.080
remember your index laws for these n

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.800
values I know this may seem a little bit

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.879
confusing

00:08:29.879 --> 00:08:31.759
but I promise the questions aren't that

00:08:31.759 --> 00:08:34.799
bad to explain it better let me try and

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:38.599
use another example so let's say that X

00:08:38.599 --> 00:08:41.958
represents the average weight of a can

00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:45.240
of Coke produced by a factory where X is

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:49.480
normally distributed with mean 250 g and

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.720
standard deviation 2 G if we took a

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.959
sample of 10 cans this sample now has

00:08:56.959 --> 00:09:01.680
two properties it has its sample sum S10

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.399
and its sample mean xar 10 now in this

00:09:05.399 --> 00:09:08.800
case the sample sum S10 is found by

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.880
adding up the weights of the cans right

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.720
so S10 actually represents the total

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.440
weight of 10 cans remember that the key

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:21.800
word for sample sum is total the sample

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.680
mean xar 10 represents the average

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:29.519
weight of a can in a sample of 10 so

00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:32.040
that's the key word for sample mean

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.760
average S10 and X10 both have their own

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.320
distribution they're normally

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.920
distributed but don't worry about why

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.360
we'll talk about that later for now we

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.360
just need to be able to use these

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.880
formulas to find the mean and standard

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.360
deviation of the sample sum and the

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.800
sample mean so for S10 which is the

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.120
total weight of 10 cans that would just

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.880
be 10 * 250 which is

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.839
2,500 and then then the standard

00:09:59.839 --> 00:10:02.560
deviation would be the standard

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:08.680
deviation * root n so 2 * otk 10 for xar

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:12.320
10 we can use these two formulas so the

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.480
mean of xar n is just the population

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.720
mean which is 250 and then the standard

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.760
deviation is the standard deviation idun

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:26.760
n so that would be 2un 10 just a quick

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.440
reminder from continuous random

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.000
variables that this squar is just for

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.160
notation so the standard deviation is

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.880
actually this number in the brackets

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.839
okay let's do some questions we have the

00:10:38.839 --> 00:10:41.639
random variable X which is the duration

00:10:41.639 --> 00:10:45.279
of one song on a playlist X has mean 3

00:10:45.279 --> 00:10:48.120
minutes and standard deviation 0.5

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.959
minutes so part A says what does s16

00:10:51.959 --> 00:10:55.440
represent remember that the key word for

00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:00.440
s or the sample sum was total so s16

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:04.680
represents the total length of 16 songs

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.760
in other words how long would it take to

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:10.240
play 16 songs back to back part B says

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:13.519
find the mean and standard deviation of

00:11:13.519 --> 00:11:17.120
s16 let's first find the mean of s16

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.279
this is equal to n multiplied by the

00:11:20.279 --> 00:11:25.279
population mean so in this case n is 16

00:11:25.279 --> 00:11:28.200
because we're taking a sample of 16 and

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.760
the population mean is 3 minutes so 16 *

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.800
3 which is 48 minutes the standard

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.839
deviation of

00:11:37.839 --> 00:11:41.399
s16 is the square root of n * the

00:11:41.399 --> 00:11:44.519
population standard deviation which isun

00:11:44.519 --> 00:11:49.839
16 multiplied 0.5 which is 2 minutes

00:11:49.839 --> 00:11:53.600
part C says what does xar 16 represent

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:58.040
so xar 16 is the sample mean for a

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.000
sample of 16 16 songs remember that the

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.560
key word for sample mean was average so

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:08.079
xar 16 represents the average length of

00:12:08.079 --> 00:12:11.639
a song in a sample of 16 Part D says

00:12:11.639 --> 00:12:14.000
find the mean and standard deviation for

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.680
xar 16 so the mean of xar 16 is just

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.600
equal to the mean of X which is 3

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.360
minutes and the standard deviation for

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:28.360
xar 16 is the standard deviation of X

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:34.399
over The < TK of n so that is 0.5 /un 16

00:12:34.399 --> 00:12:35.880
which is

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.040
0.125

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.800
minutes all right let's do another

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:44.079
question in this one we have the random

00:12:44.079 --> 00:12:47.880
variable X which represents the weight

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.440
of a tulip in a flower shop X is

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.160
normally distributed with mean 20 and

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.240
standard deviation 2 part A says what

00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:01.000
does xar 25 and S 25 represent remember

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
that the key word for xar was average so

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.440
xar 25 would be the average weight of a

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.120
tulip in a bunch of

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:17.959
25 and the keyw for SN was total so s25

00:13:17.959 --> 00:13:20.480
represents the total weight of a bunch

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:24.240
of 25 tulips Part B says find the mean

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:28.000
and standard deviation for s25 we can do

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.079
this using the form formulas the mean

00:13:30.079 --> 00:13:35.440
for s25 is equal n * the mean of X which

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:39.360
is 25 multiplied the mean of X which is

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:43.639
20 which is 500 the standard deviation

00:13:43.639 --> 00:13:48.600
of s25 isun n multiplied the standard

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:54.040
deviation of X so this is 2 * by < TK

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:58.480
25 which is 2 * 5 which is 10 part C

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.079
says says find the standard deviation

00:14:01.079 --> 00:14:03.560
and mean of xar

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:07.160
25 again we can use the formulas the

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:12.160
mean of xar 25 is just the mean of X so

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.240
this is equal to 20 and the standard

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:19.160
deviation of xar 25 is the standard

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:26.240
deviation of x /un n so this is 2 over <

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:32.160
tk25 which is equal to 2 on 5 or 0.4

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.279
finally in part D it says what happens

00:14:35.279 --> 00:14:40.279
to the standard deviation of xar n as n

00:14:40.279 --> 00:14:43.079
increases to answer this let's write

00:14:43.079 --> 00:14:45.199
down the formula for the standard

00:14:45.199 --> 00:14:48.360
deviation of x n this is equal to the

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:52.480
standard deviation of x overun n so we

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.800
can see that as n increases since n is

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.040
on the bottom of the fraction this

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.120
number should should decrease because

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.360
we're dividing by a bigger and bigger

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.480
number this property is in general by

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.120
the way for All sample means and not

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.639
just this particular question but let's

00:15:10.639 --> 00:15:13.160
explain why this makes sense using this

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:16.839
example in this case X represents the

00:15:16.839 --> 00:15:19.000
weight of one tulip which is sold by a

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.040
flower shop so X is normally distributed

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:25.560
with mean 20 and therefore the weights

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.759
of some of the Tulips could be like 20

00:15:27.759 --> 00:15:31.959
22 23 24 if I found a tulet which had

00:15:31.959 --> 00:15:35.120
weight 24 that's two standard deviations

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.240
above the mean so while it's not that

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.680
likely I wouldn't be too surprised right

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:44.360
now consider xar 25 like we have in this

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.920
question this represents the average

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:50.440
weight of a tulip in a sample of 25 so

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:54.120
for this to take a value of 24 we'd have

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.240
to pick 25 tulips and all of them would

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:00.519
have to average to a weight of 24 in

00:16:00.519 --> 00:16:02.600
other words pretty much all of them

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.480
would have to have a weight which is two

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.759
standard deviations above the mean now

00:16:07.759 --> 00:16:11.720
for one tulip to sit in this value it's

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:15.759
reasonably likely however for all 25

00:16:15.759 --> 00:16:17.680
tulips to have an average around this

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.720
value it's very very very unlikely so

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.720
what this means is as we increase n or

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.759
we increase the sample size the values

00:16:26.759 --> 00:16:29.920
of xar n become come closer and closer

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.800
distributed around the mean or in other

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.959
words the standard deviation decreases

00:16:35.959 --> 00:16:38.480
so if I had to draw a distribution of X

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.600
it may look something like this but then

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.360
if I drew xar 25 it may look something

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.839
like this notice how they have the same

00:16:45.839 --> 00:16:49.279
mean but the standard deviation of xar

00:16:49.279 --> 00:16:53.480
25 has been reduced okay next question

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.040
in this one we're given a random

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:59.160
variable X which has a probability

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.279
distribution here recall that this kind

00:17:02.279 --> 00:17:04.199
of looks like the probability

00:17:04.199 --> 00:17:06.559
distributions we were dealing with when

00:17:06.559 --> 00:17:09.280
we were doing discrete random variables

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.919
part A says find the probability

00:17:11.919 --> 00:17:17.359
distribution for S2 so remember that S2

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:21.000
represents the sum when we take this

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.160
random variable twice we can read this

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.520
probability distribution table to see

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.320
what it would be if if we took this

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.880
variable once if we took it once there's

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:35.080
two values 1 and three and here are

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.840
their corresponding probabilities if we

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.960
took it twice and added them together we

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.440
could get a one and a one which would

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:46.760
make two we could get a one and a three

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.840
which would make four we could get a

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.960
three and then a one which would also

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.400
make four and then we could get a three

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.480
and a three which would make six so

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.880
therefore there are three possible

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:05.280
values for S2 those are 2 4 and 6 now

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.919
let's calculate the probabilities for S2

00:18:08.919 --> 00:18:12.600
for S2 to have a value of two we'd have

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:16.640
to get 1 and then 1 again so we can find

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:21.799
this probability by 2 on 5 * 2 on 5 to

00:18:21.799 --> 00:18:25.400
get a four we either get a 1 and then a

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:29.600
three or a three and then a 1

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.840
so to get a 1 and then a three that

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:37.520
would be 2 5 * 3 5 and then to get a

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.360
three and then a 1 that would be 3 on 5

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:43.600
* 2 on 5 which is the same as this so

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.480
essentially it's this * 2 right to get a

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.520
six we would have to get three and then

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:54.159
three so that's 3 on 5 * 3 on 5 I'm just

00:18:54.159 --> 00:18:56.200
going to put each of these values here

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.440
into my calculator and see what they

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:03.880
come out at so 2 on 5^ 2 is 4 on 25 2 on

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:10.960
5 * 3 on 5 * 2 is 12 on 25 and 3 on 5^ 2

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:15.760
is 9 on 25 part B says find the mean and

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:19.600
standard deviation for S2 there are two

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.120
ways we could go about doing this notice

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.600
that we have a distribution table here

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:28.960
for S2 and we can use the formulas to

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:32.200
find the mean and the standard deviation

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:34.400
of this random variable remember that

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.919
these were from discrete random

00:19:35.919 --> 00:19:38.360
variables another way of doing this

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.360
would be to use those formulas to find

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:43.720
the mean and standard deviation of X and

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.720
then use the sampling formulas to find

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.679
these values because we're doing

00:19:48.679 --> 00:19:51.039
sampling let's do it that way so the

00:19:51.039 --> 00:19:52.960
first thing we want to do is find the

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:57.039
mean of X that's this variable here

00:19:57.039 --> 00:19:59.039
remember that the form formula to do

00:19:59.039 --> 00:20:01.320
this for a probability distribution

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:05.919
table was the sum of x i p i which is 1

00:20:05.919 --> 00:20:12.360
* 2 on 5 + 3 * 3 on 5 which is 11 on 5

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:15.799
the standard deviation of X is Big

00:20:15.799 --> 00:20:20.480
Square t and then the sum of x i^ 2 p i

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:24.320
minus the mean s subbing this in we have

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:31.400
the < TK of 1^ 2 * 2 5 + 3^ 2 * 3 5 and

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.640
then we're subtracting the mean squ so -

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:38.400
11 on 5 all 2 putting this into the

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:42.400
calculator gives us a value of < TK4 on

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:46.640
5 so now we found the mean and the

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:49.760
standard deviation of this random

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:53.280
variable we can use the formulas to find

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.720
the mean and standard deviation for S2

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.679
the mean of s

00:20:58.679 --> 00:21:05.080
S2 is n * the mean of X which is 2 * 11

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:08.840
5 which is 22 on 5 the standard

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:14.559
deviation of S2 is square < TK n multili

00:21:14.559 --> 00:21:17.679
the standard deviation of X so that's <

00:21:17.679 --> 00:21:23.320
tk2 * by < TK4 on 5 and that gives us <

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:28.480
TK 48 on 5 part C says find the standard

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:32.159
deviation and mean for s50 so to do this

00:21:32.159 --> 00:21:36.000
we can use the same formulas the mean of

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.640
s50 is equal to 50 * the mean of X which

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:44.480
we said before was 11 on 5 that's equal

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:48.760
to 110 and the standard deviation of

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:53.440
s50 isun 50 * by the standard deviation

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:58.360
of X which is < TK4 on 5 which is is

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.960
using my calculator approximately equal

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.320
to

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.840
6.93 finally we need to find the mean

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:08.000
and standard deviation of xar 50 the

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.919
mean of xar 50 is just equal to the mean

00:22:11.919 --> 00:22:15.720
of X which is 11 on 5 and the standard

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:19.320
deviation of xar 50 is the standard

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:23.960
deviation of X over < tk50 so that is <

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:28.799
TK4 5 overun 50 and again using the

00:22:28.799 --> 00:22:31.279
calculator this is approximately equal

00:22:31.279 --> 00:22:33.360
to

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.200
0.139 okay that's the end of this video

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.159
after watching this one you should be

00:22:38.159 --> 00:22:40.640
able to do these things interpret the

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:45.159
sample sum SN and Sample mean xar n

00:22:45.159 --> 00:22:48.880
remember that the keyw for SN was total

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:52.520
and the keyw for xar n was average

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.799
secondly we need to be able to use the

00:22:54.799 --> 00:22:57.440
formulas to find the mean and standard

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:58.480
deviation

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.200
for each of these and finally this was

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.520
that last question which was a bit weird

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.320
we need to be able to find the

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:08.919
probability distribution for SN if we're

00:23:08.919 --> 00:23:12.360
given the probability distribution of X

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.480
these last questions don't come up as

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.919
much in tests but we still need to be

00:23:16.919 --> 00:23:19.960
able to do them
